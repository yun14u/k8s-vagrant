# Kubernetes
## Objective
To simulate a K8s cluster using Vagrant with VirtualBox.

## Status
- I spin up a K8s cluster with at least 2 nodes (controlplane + 1 worker node). I have been using it to test K8s v1.3x.
- The Vagrantfile has been been tested with the following environments
  - Windows Desktop - Windows v10
  - Ubuntu Notebook - Ubuntu 22 (jammy), Ubuntu 24 (noble)
